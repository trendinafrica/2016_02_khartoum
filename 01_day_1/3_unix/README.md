## Unix basics

In this session we'll do a hands-on introduction to Unix and the command-line.

We'll work through the material [here](http://trendinafrica.github.io/command_line_bootcamp/guide/00_frontmatter.html).

Hopefully we can do this using the interactive web interface we've set up for it:  http://trendinafrica.github.io/command_line_bootcamp. However, if the internet drops out, we can also use the terminal directly (we'll do this later anyway).
